# 📋 Project Overview
This project transforms raw ticketing data into an interactive Help Desk Performance Dashboard. The goal was to provide IT managers with a "single pane of glass" to monitor service health, identify recurring technical bottlenecks, and ensure the team is meeting Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

By analyzing ticket lifecycles, I identified key areas where automation or better documentation could reduce ticket volume and improve user satisfaction.
